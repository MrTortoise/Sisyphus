It's Friday night

Cyril is trying to fix his transdimensional toastie maker. Some people might say causing the cheese to travel through several dimensions in the blink of an eye is excessive, by Cyril thinks it's the only way to get the perfect balance of melt and flavour in the shortest possible time. Cyril wants it now. Sometimes now is in 5 minutes. Sometimes now is 1864. There are some teething issues.

"Maybe if I just...

FIRST CHOICE (1.0)
1. Wangle the flompinator
2. Press the big red button
3. Install a de-clogger

1.1 You give the Flompinator a good wangle. The Flompinator crackles. You've accidentally moved to last Tuesday when you installed the Flompinator. More importantly the cheese has reverted to milk and the bread is just dough. And a whole lot of other shit happens. I'm spitballing for concept. Eventunually you get back to the room somehow and choose 2 or 3. Possibly a whole chunk of storyline.

1.2. The big red button cause the end of the universe. well done.

1.3. You need to build a de-clogger. You go build a de-clogger somehow. This will be a quest in itself. This option will actually progress the story as more things will be needed to fix the thing.

Option 1 expanded

The Flompinator crackles. You've accidentally moved to last Tuesday when you installed the Flompinator. More importantly the cheese has reverted to milk and the bread is just dough.

Something appears to have gone awry. 

1. Kick the fucking thing

2. Ponder the meaning of existence

1.1 you kicked the fucking thing. Again it sparks into life, sucking you into a dimension comprised primarily of fire. This would be useful for making toasties, but sadly the only toastly thing is you.

The end.

1.2 You stroke your chin for several days. Eventually you arrive back at Friday, and prapare some cheese and bread for the testing process

Back at choice one.

Choice Two

You've pressed the big red button. Oh dear. 

Let's just say that's the end. 

Ok. 

Look, the machine divided the universe by zero. That was an unexpected design flaw, as was the big red button itself. 

3. 
3.1 You spend an enjoyable 30 minutess designing, building and installing a de-clogger. It looks beautiful but does nothing

back to 1 with new option 1.4

decise what option 4 is.

1.4 Tinker with the cheese matrix.

1.4 Cyril enjoys many kinds of cheese and, as one does in such situations, has created aseries of time/space loop holes in his fridge, each dedicated to a particular type of chese. The cheese matrix controls the selection and quantity of cheese transported from fridge to toastie.
