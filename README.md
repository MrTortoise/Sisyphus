# The Sisyphus Project #

The Sisyphus project is a multi dimensional story editor and replayer. The intention is to create a story that has depth of character and narrative. The unique aspect is being able to traverse a story through one or more characters perspectives and make decisions (if you wish) to explore possibilities in the universe of the story. The replayability aspect comes from being able to choose which characters perspectives you wish to explore the world from.

This project has 2 aspects, the engine/editor and the next phase which will be an open contribution based system for building up the breadth and depth of characters.
